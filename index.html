    <h4 id="hobby1">Leatherworking</h4>
        <p>I started leatherworking several years ago when I saw one of my friends livestreaming his work online. 
            I had done some in the past but it never really hooked me. The second time around, it got me. Now I have been 
            working the craft for the last 6 years, making wallets, belts, and custom day carry bags.</p>
    <h4 id="vtuber">Vtuber/3d/2d model rigging</h4>
        <p>I also enjoy spending time creating and customizing Vtubers for use on streaming media platforms. This
            is a very recent hobby which I am very new to, but have had a lot of fun with and hopefully will get
            much better at it.</p>
